---------------- To Do ----------------

- After finishing all rounds in the minimalist mode and having minimize after complete turned on, once restored from being minimized, the main window shows up alongside the minimalist widget
	
- The preset buttons to load presets should allow the user to see the values associated with it, possibly through tooltips with the info

- Add the preset menu to the minimalist mode context/right click menu



---------------- Eventual ----------------

- Have checkboxes in the right click context menu of minimalist mode for 'Always on Top' and 'Minimize After Complete'

- Text pop ups at the bottom of the window when loading or saving seem to mess up spacing of text below 'Start' button and above Progress Bar and squish it a bit

- Takes a while to boot the exe
	- Maybe add a loading indicator for feedback
